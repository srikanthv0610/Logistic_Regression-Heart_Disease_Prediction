# Logistic_Regression-Heart_Disease_Prediction
Usin the heart dataset [here](https://github.com/srikanthv0610/Logistic_Regression-Heart_Disease_Prediction/blob/main/Dataset), I have designed this model for:
* Analysing the different variables and finding relations and insights using descriptive statistical analysis technique
* Data Preprocessing
* Splitting the data into train and test sets
* Using Logistic Regression algorithm to train a model and to predict heart disease
* Analysing the Models performance

# Introduction:
Factors that influence heart disease are body cholesterol levels, smoking habit and obesity, family history of illnesses, blood pressure, and work environment. Machine learning algorithms play an essential and precise role in the prediction of heart disease. 

Heart disease can be predicted based on various symptoms such as age, gender, heart rate, etc. and reduces the death rate of heart patients.
